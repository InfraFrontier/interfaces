Disclaimer
The current level of quality control (QC) performed before the mice are shipped is to:
    Confirm the individual mouse genotype by qPCR counting the copy number variation of the neo marker and either SR-PCR or LoA qPCR. The 3? LoxP is also verified where appropriate by qPCR or SR-PCR.
    Confirm the location of the targeted mutation for the colony by long-range PCR (LR-PCR), by the detection of homozygous mice by gene specific SR-PCR and/or by loss of wild type allele (LoA) qPCR.

The structure of the targeted mutation is not fully verified. It is recommended that the recipient confirms the mutation structure by Southern blotting.

Please be aware that the strain description may be subject to change. For the most recent description please consult the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC; <http://www.knockoutmouse.org>) information pages for the appropriate project.
