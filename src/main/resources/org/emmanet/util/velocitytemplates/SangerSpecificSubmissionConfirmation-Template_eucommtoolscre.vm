Dear EMMA customer,

We would like to confirm receipt of the order form that you submitted to EMMA for ${strainname} (${emmaid})
Your request ID is: ${requestID}

You will be contacted within two weeks by the EMMA partner responsible for distributing the strain you have requested. 

The strain you are interested in has been produced by the Sanger Institute Mouse Genetics Project (Sanger MGP). 
 
Without exception, shipment will not proceed without a completed Material Transfer Agreement (MTA). In our experience, this can be a lengthy procedure. If a partially executed document has not already been submitted we recommend starting this process immediately. 
Please find attached the MTA template for your convenience. To expedite processing of the MTA, please follow these guidelines: 
    -   Only MTA documents signed by individuals authorized by your Institution for that purpose will be accepted.
    -   The MTA is non-negotiable.
    -   For the section “Description of Materials”, please use this specific language but change the gene symbol and the request ID as appropriate for your request: 
            "Mice or frozen material derived from a colony containing mutants for the gene [gene symbol]. Request ID:[####]."

    -   The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute accepts MTAs in PDF format. The partially executed document may be sent to mousemta@sanger.ac.uk.

Please be aware that the shipping costs will be covered by your Institution. In addition, an EMMA Service Fee will apply at the time the Order Form is completed. See rates at <${BASEURL}resources-and-services/access-emma-mouse-resources/strain-ordering>. 

The standard quantity supplied is 2 breeding pairs.
To potentially accelerate availability please indicate if you would consider receiving 2 males only. Standard Service Fee applies (<${BASEURL}resources-and-services/access-emma-mouse-resources/strain-ordering>).

Should you have any general questions, please do not hesitate to contact the INFRAFRONTIER Project Office (info@infrafrontier.eu).
For enquiries related to the progress of the resource development please contact mouseinterest@sanger.ac.uk


Thank you for your interest in EMMA.

Disclaimer

The current level of quality control (QC) performed before the mice are shipped is to:

    -   Confirm the individual mouse genotype by qPCR counting the copy number variation of the Cre gene and by loss of wild type allele (LoA) qPCR.
The LoA qPCR is gene specific and also confirms the location of the targeted mutation

The structure of the targeted mutation is not fully verified. It is recommended that the recipient confirms the mutation structure by Southern blotting.

The Cre expression pattern is expected to mirror that of the host gene, but this may not be fully described and/or may be modified in the targeted allele.  Although characterisation of the Cre expression pattern is an objective of EUCOMMTools this is an ongoing process which may be incomplete.  It is therefore recommended that the recipient verifies the Cre expression pattern.  For the tm1(EGFP_CreERT2) type allele, if the promoter-driven selection cassette is flanked with Rox sites, it may be removed using Dre recombinase.
Please be aware that the strain description may be subject to change. For the most recent description please consult the CREATE website (www.creline.org/eucommtools) information pages for the appropriate product details.
