Dear EMMA customer,

We would like to confirm receipt of the order form that you submitted to EMMA for ${strainname} (${emmaid})
Your request ID is: ${requestID}

You will be contacted within two weeks by the EMMA partner responsible for distributing the strain you have requested. 

The strain you are interested in has been produced by the Sanger Institute Mouse Genetics Project (Sanger MGP). 
 
Without exception, shipment will not proceed without a completed Material Transfer Agreement (MTA). In our experience, this can be a lengthy procedure. If a partially executed document has not already been submitted we recommend starting this process immediately. 
Please find attached the MTA template for your convenience. To expedite processing of the MTA, please follow these guidelines: 
    -   Only MTA documents signed by individuals authorized by your Institution for that purpose will be accepted.
    -   The MTA is non-negotiable.
    -   For the section "Description of Material", please use this specific language but change the gene symbol and the request ID as appropriate for your request: 
            "Mice or frozen material derived from a colony containing mutants for the gene [gene symbol]. Request ID:[${requestID}]."

    -   The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute accepts MTAs in PDF format. The partially executed document may be sent to mousemta@sanger.ac.uk.

Please be aware that the shipping costs will be covered by your Institution. In addition, an EMMA Service Fee will apply at the time the Order Form is completed. See rates at <${BASEURL}resources-and-services/access-emma-mouse-resources/strain-ordering>. 

The standard quantity supplied is 2 breeding pairs.
To potentially accelerate availability please indicate if you would consider receiving 2 males only. Standard Service Fee applies (<${BASEURL}resources-and-services/access-emma-mouse-resources/strain-ordering>).

Should you have any general questions, please do not hesitate to contact the INFRAFRONTIER Project Office (info@infrafrontier.eu).
For enquiries related to the progress of the resource development please contact mouseinterest@sanger.ac.uk


Thank you for your interest in EMMA.

Disclaimer

CRISPR/Cas9 derived exon deletions (zygote): The current level of quality control (QC) before the mice are shipped is to:

    -Confirm the mutation for the colony by LoA qPCR, gene-specific endpoint PCR and Sanger sequencing
    -Confirm the individual mouse genotype by loss of wildtype allele qPCR (LoA) and gene-specific endpoint PCR

CRISPR/Cas9 derived point mutations (zygote): The current level of quality control (QC) performed before the mice are shipped is to:

    -Confirm the mutation for the colony by gene-specific endpoint PCR and Sanger sequencing
    -Confirm the individual mouse genotype by gene-specific endpoint PCR

It is recommended that the recipient confirms the structure of the mutation by endpoint PCR and sequencing.

Potential off-target effects produced by the CRISPR/Cas9 method may not have been investigated for this strain. 

A pilot study on ten strains was carried out investigating the ten most likely potential off-target sites for each gRNA. For nine strains no off-target effects were observed. For one strain a putative 1bp change was identified in an intergenic region of the genome on a different chromosome to the desired mutation.

Please be aware that the strain description may be subject to change. For the most recent description please consult the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC; www.mousephenotype.org) information pages for the appropriate product details.
