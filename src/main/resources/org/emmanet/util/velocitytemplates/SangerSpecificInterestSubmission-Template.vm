IMPORTANT INFORMATION. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

Dear EMMA customer

We would like to confirm receipt of the Registration of Interest (RoI) for ${strainname} (${emmaid}).
Your request ID is: ${requestID}

The strain you are interested in has been produced by the Sanger Institute Mouse Genetics Project (Sanger MGP). The Sanger MGP provides an opportunity to obtain mice prior to archiving at a distribution centre. However, please note that at this time, we can NOT guarantee there will be mice available for shipment nor provide a shipping date. Should mice become available for shipment, we will notify you by email. At that time you will be required to complete an Order Form before shipment can proceed. 
 
Without exception, shipment will not proceed without a completed Material Transfer Agreement (MTA). In our experience, this can be a lengthy procedure we therefore recommend starting this process immediately. 
Please find attached the MTA template for your convenience. To expedite processing of the MTA, please follow these guidelines:

    -   Only MTA documents signed by individuals authorized by your Institution for that purpose will be accepted.
    -   The MTA is non-negotiable.
    -   For the section "Description of Material", please use this specific language but change the gene symbol and the request ID as appropriate for your request: 
            "Mice or frozen material derived from a colony containing mutants for the gene [gene symbol]. Request ID:[${requestID}]."

    -    The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute accepts MTAs in PDF format. The partially executed document may be sent to mousemta@sanger.ac.uk.

Please be aware that the shipping costs will be covered by your Institution. In addition, an EMMA Service Fee will apply at the time the Order Form is completed. See rates at <${BASEURL}resources-and-services/access-emma-mouse-resources/strain-ordering>. 

The standard quantity supplied is 2 breeding pairs.
To potentially accelerate availability please indicate if you would consider receiving 2 males only. Standard Service Fee applies (<${BASEURL}resources-and-services/access-emma-mouse-resources/strain-ordering>).

Should you have any general questions, please do not hesitate to contact the INFRAFRONTIER Project Office (info@infrafrontier.eu).
For enquiries related to the progress of the resource development please contact mouseinterest@sanger.ac.uk


Thank you for your interest in EMMA.

Kind regards,

Disclaimer

The current level of quality control (QC) performed before the mice are shipped is to:

    -  Confirm the individual mouse genotype by qPCR counting the copy number variation of the neo marker and either SR-PCR or LoA qPCR. The 3’ LoxP is also verified where appropriate by qPCR or SR-PCR.
    -  Confirm the location of the targeted mutation for the colony by long-range PCR (LR-PCR), by the detection of homozygous mice by gene specific SR-PCR and/or by loss of wild type allele (LoA) qPCR.

The structure of the targeted mutation is not fully verified. It is recommended that the recipient confirms the mutation structure by Southern blotting.

Please be aware that the strain description may be subject to change. For the most recent description please consult the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC; www.mousephenotype.org) information pages for the appropriate product details.
