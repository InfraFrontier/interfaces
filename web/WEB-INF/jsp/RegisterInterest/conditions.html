                        The EMMA nodes have similar administrative arrangements for the deposition and distribution of EMMA mice, including ensuring that the rights of depositors are protected and that the liabilities of nodes are limited. Special arrangements apply for the UK. However, in general, the following conditions apply, which may apply simply as conditions attached to the transaction or, alternatively, appears in some form within an MTA attached to the transaction.</p>

                        <p class="left">The European Mouse Mutant Archive (EMMA) is a federation of several research facilities in the field of mouse genetics from different European countries and was established to coordinate, archive and distribute mutant mouse lines.</p>
                        
                        <p class="left">A list of the available mutant mouse lines is regularly updated and available at http://www.emmanet.org.</p>
                        
                        <p class="left">EMMA-maintained lines are supplied to interested institutions/investigators, for use in non-Commercial activities only, as a non-profit service to the research community at large by the respective research facility that submits the mouse line (Provider). EMMA coordinates requests and acts as the distributor of mouse lines stored with EMMA (Distributor).</p>
