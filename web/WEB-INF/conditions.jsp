                                                    The EMMA nodes have similar administrative arrangements for the deposition and distribution of EMMA mice, including ensuring that the rights of depositors are protected and that the liabilities of nodes are limited. Special arrangements apply for the UK. However, in general, the following conditions apply, which may apply simply as conditions attached to the transaction or, alternatively, appears in some form within an MTA attached to the transaction.</p>

                                                <p class="left">LEGALLY BINDING GENERAL CONDITIONS <br>
                                                    CONCERNING THE REQUEST AND TRANSFER OF MUTANT MOUSE STRAINS FROM THE EUROPEAN MOUSE MUTANT ARCHIVE</p>

                                                <p class="left">The European Mouse Mutant Archive (EMMA) is a federation of several research facilities in the field of mouse genetics from different European countries and was established to coordinate, archive and distribute mutant mouse lines.</p>

                                                <p class="left">A list of the available mutant mouse lines is regularly updated and available at http://www.emmanet.org.</p>

                                                <p class="left">EMMA-maintained lines are supplied to interested institutions/investigators, for use in non-Commercial activities only, as a non-profit service to the research community at large by the respective research facility that submits the mouse line (Provider). EMMA coordinates requests and acts as the distributor of mouse lines stored with EMMA (Distributor).</p>

                                                <p class="left">Where applicable, the Distributor will furbish to the recipient institution, including its employees and other researchers under its control (Recipient), the Providers Material Transfer Agreement.  Requests will not be processed by the Distributor until two (2) duly executed copies have been received by the Distributor.</p>

                                                <p class="left">Depending on the mouse line, the requested material may consist of frozen sperm, frozen embryos or live mice (Material).  The breeding, handling and storage of the Material shall comply with the established rules and regulations that apply in the country of the Provider or the Distributor, respectively.</p>

                                                <p class="left">Each Recipient who requests and receives Material from the Distributor hereby expressly agrees to the following conditions:</p>
                                                <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                                                    <p class="left">1. The Material is provided for non-Commercial research and teaching purposes only. The Recipient must not transfer the requested Material, which is owned by the Provider and shall comprise any progeny, unmodified derivatives or original material contained in modifications thereof derived by inbreeding or crossbreeding, to any third party.</p>
                                                    <p class="left">2. The information made available by the Distributor to the Recipient along with and related to the Material is based on, to the best of Distributors knowledge, the corresponding information given by the Provider.</p>
                                                    <p class="left">3. Material is made available to Recipient on the condition that the Recipient reasonably proves their ability to comply with all relevant National, International and European rules with regard to the handling, breeding and manipulating the Material as evidenced by specific legal authorisations delivered by appropriate control bodies.</p>
                                                    <p class="left">4. The Material provided to the Recipient is experimental in nature and may have hazardous properties. Provider and Distributor make no representations and extend no warranties of any kind, express or implied, as to the fitness of the Material for a particular purpose, or that the use thereof will not infringe any patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights of a third party.</p>
                                                    <p class="left">5. Except where required to ensure that the transfer to, and use of, such Material by the Recipient does not infringe known third party intellectual property rights or where the Recipients prior signature of a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) is required by the Provider before distribution of the Material, the Distributor does not restrict availability of the Material on the basis of intellectual property rights and shall not enforce any restrictions based on these rights other than prior signature of the Providers Material Transfer Agreement.</p>
                                                    <p class="left">6. The Recipient assumes all and any liability for damages, which may arise from their use, storage or disposal of the provided Material. The Recipient shall hold harmless the Provider and Distributor for any loss, claim or demand which could be raised by the Recipient, or made against the Recipient by any other party, due to, or arising from, the use, storage or disposal of the Material by the Recipient, except to the extent such loss, claim or demand is caused by the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Provider or Distributor.</p>
                                                    <p class="left">7. The Material is provided by the Distributor with a transmittal fee (consisting of appropriate shipping fees and a service charge for storage, stock replenishment and handling of the Material), which shall be paid by the Recipient to the Distributor.</p>
                                                    <p class="left">8. Any request received from the Recipient to use Material for a Commercial activity shall be referred to the Provider. To avoid doubt, the Distributor shall not be involved in any negotiations between the Provider and Recipient in relation to use of the Material for any Commercial activity.</p>
                                                    <p class="left">9. The Recipient agrees to acknowledge the Provider and EMMA as Distributor in any publication or presentation reporting on research involving an EMMA strain.</p>
